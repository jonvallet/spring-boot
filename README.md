Spring boot rest data service example

## Build ##
```sh
$ ./gradlew build
```

## Run ##
```sh
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

A local server should start after a few moments and it will be listening and ready
for requests at http://localhost:8080

There is a postman collection at the postman folder that you can use to test the rest
endpoint.
